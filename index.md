You can use legal documents to say how to make health care decisions about you if you become sick or unable to make decisions yourself.  These documents can protect you and your family from unnecessary pain, suffering, stress, and cost.

Names and terms for these documents vary widely.  You may have heard names like "advance healthcare directive", "living will", "personal directive", "power of attorney", and "health care proxy".  What to do next depends on the state where you live:

<ul>
{% for state in site.states %}
<li><a href="{{state.permalink}}">{{state.title | escape }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
