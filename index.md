You can use legal documents to say how to make health care decisions about you if you become sick or unable to make decisions yourself.  These documents can protect you and your family from unnecessary pain, suffering, stress, and cost.

## How?

That depends on which state you live in:

<ul>
{% for state in site.states %}
<li><a href="{{state.permalink}}">{{state.title | escape }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Pitch In

If you're a lawyer, translator, or legal editor and want to help improve this site, [join the mailing list](https://lists.kemitchell.com/postorius/lists/prepperpaper.lists.kemitchell.com/) and send the group an e-mail.  Of special interest: those willing and able to do the research and come up with playbooks to get documents signed when folks are already admitted to hospital under quarantine.
