## Lawyers

The State Bar of California publishes [a list of certified lawyer referral services](https://www.calbar.ca.gov/Public/Need-Legal-Help/Lawyer-Referral-Service) that can connect you to a lawyer in your area.  You can tell them you need help with an "advance healthcare directive".

## Reference

- Probate Code Section 4701 codifies the statutory form for advance healthcare directives: [online](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?sectionNum=4701.&lawCode=PROB), [PDF](/resources/california/probate-4701.pdf)
